For an initial sample, I searched for job advertisements that contained the phrases “cyber defense” or 
“cyber analyst” on the website Indeed to find companies that would likely hire a number of cyber security 
professionals. Reviews for companies from Information Security Analysts, IT Security Specialists, Information
Security Analysts, SERP Cyber Security Analysts, SERP & IT Principle Cybersecurity Analysts were included. This
resulted in a sample of 128 reviews from 23 companies. 

I scraped the websites using the ‘requests’ package available with python. The following variables were extracted 
from each review: company, overall rating, worklife/balance rating, compensation and benefits rating, job security 
rating, management rating, corporate culture rating, location (city, state), date review (Month, Day, Year), position,
status, review, pros, cons.
